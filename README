This is an NES emulator for Linux systems, with experimental support
for Mac OS X. It will likely build on other flavors of Unix with
minimal source tweaking. A large number of popular NES titles are
playable with accurate graphics and sound.

It features fullscreen support, high quality NTSC simulation and
aspect ratio correction, reasonable compatibility with most North
American (NES) titles and mappers, audio, gamepad support,
save/restore state, and demo recording. It has a GUI (work in
progress) or can be invoked from the command line.

It may build on Windows, but there are known problems. In particular,
the UI assumes a unix-style filesystem.

The source license is currently in limbo, with a plan to moving toward
an MIT-style license, pending the replacement of the M6502 CPU core,
which was written by a third party with incompatible, undesirable
license constraints.

Known bugs / TODO items:
 * UI broken on OS X (?)
 * Save/restore/configure controller button maps
 * Controller config GUI
 * MMC2, MMC4, MMC5 mapper support
 * VRC6 mapper (Akumajou Densetsu)
 * MMC3 timing / quirks (SMB3, TMNT2, others)
 * Replace M6502 core
 * Fix license
 * Scanlines in NTSC simulation (?)
 * Correct interrupt acknowledgement
 * Misc. accuracy fixes to satisfy the various test roms.

One neat feature: A FUSE filesystem providing read/write access to a
live view of the emulator memory. Enable by exporting "USE_FUSE=1" in
the environment before compiling, then run the program as:

   tenes -mountfs -mountpoint MOUNTPOINT
