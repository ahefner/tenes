I got bored one day and decided to throw the NES' video up on the
scope and see what it was outputting.  I used an Agilent 54622D
mixed signal scope for the tests.

For testing, I wrote a small palette test program that output four
solid colour bars, left to right, with a 2 pixel divider between
each coloured area.  These dividers made convenient reference marks
when looking at the signal on the scope.

I measured the voltage on the emitter of the amplifier transistor
connected to the PPU's video output pin.  An original model top loader
was used for the tests.



                                   /-- C.B. High Level
                               ^^^^^
 Black Level ->  -----       --VVVVV
                      |     |      \-- C.B. Low Level
       Synch Level -> |_____|

The above represents the start of a scanline on the NES.  There are four
key voltages indicated:  black level, synch, and the burst high/low
voltage that it oscillates between to generate the burst.  There are exactly
10 cycles of 3.579MHz making up the burst. Because the NES inserts an
extra pixel every other frame, this forces the burst to have 1 of 2 different
phasings.  This is clearly seen on the scope.

As for the actual rendered video, there are only 8 different voltage levels.
The two grey sets, 00h and 0dh, conveniently output 4 of each voltage level.
This made testing rather simple.  First, I output colours 00h, 10h, 20h,
and 30h, and then colours 0dh, 1dh, 2dh, and 3dh.  The voltage levels of both
were measured.

                                /       \  /       \
           L1 hi -> /------\   <         ><________/| <- L3 lo
                   /        \ | \       /           |
                  <          >   \-----/ <- L2 lo   |
L0 hi ->  -----  | \        /                       |
         /     \ |  \------/ <- L1 lo               |
  ------<- - - -> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -----  <- black level
L0 lo -> -------                                   


               Approximate relative amplitudes, somewhat.
               

The video output itself is somewhat interesting; The two voltages each
colour luminance value oscillates between are the same as the static
greys, as discussed above.  For example, colour 15h is oscillating
between colour 1dh and 10h at a 3.579MHz rate.  The phase of this
relative to the phase of the colourburst determines the colour seen.

Interestingly, the saturation varies among the luminance values- the middle
two luma values (1 and 2) have the same saturation, but 0 and 3 are
"squashed".  Luminance 0 actually dips below the black level a tad, and
this is the cause of the issues if you use colour 0dh.  This "blacker than
black" really isn't THAT far below the black level, and it really is a long
ways from synch.  So, on most TVs, this shouldn't be too much of an issue
if you use colour 0dh for your black.

Luminance 2 and 3 both have the same upper voltage, which explains why
colours 20h and 30h give the same colour; bright white.  Incidentally, this
is the brightest colour the NES can produce, yielding the highest voltage.


Now for the data.  All voltage levels are indicated two ways:  absolute
and relative.  The absolute voltage is just that- the voltage above
ground.  The relative voltage is based off of the synch level.  No part
of the waveform has a voltage lower than synch.  Refer to the above two
diagrams for the points measured.



            |    Normal     |   Emphasis    |
            +-------+-------+-------+-------+
Signal name |  Abs  |  Rel  |  Abs  |  Rel  |
------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
synch level | 0.781 | 0.000 | 0.781 | 0.000 |
black level | 1.300 | 0.518 | 1.300 | 0.518 |
    C.B. lo | 1.000 | 0.218 | 1.000 | 0.218 |
    C.B. hi | 1.712 | 0.931 | 1.712 | 0.931 |
        ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
      L0 lo | 1.131 | 0.350 | 1.043 | 0.262 |
      L0 hi | 1.875 | 1.090 | 1.593 | 0.812 |
      L1 lo | 1.300 | 0.518 | 1.162 | 0.381 |
      L1 hi | 2.287 | 1.500 | 1.906 | 1.120 |
        ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
      L2 lo | 1.743 | 0.962 | 1.493 | 0.712 |
      L2 hi | 2.743 | 1.960 | 2.243 | 1.460 | *
      L3 lo | 2.331 | 1.550 | 1.943 | 1.160 |
      L3 hi | 2.743 | 1.960 | 2.243 | 1.460 | *
        ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+

        * these two are the same voltage level


For the "emphasis" values, I turned all 3 emphasis bits on at once and then
recorded the requisite voltages.  As was noted elsewhere, the emphasis bits
really are attenuation bits.  Turning 1 or more bits on always results in a
REDUCTION of output level, either modulated with the colour carrier(s), or
in the case of all bits on at once, a static value.  As one would guess,
the emphasis values do not affect colour burst, synch, or black level. 

In all cases, the ratio of normal to emphasis is from 1.33 to 1.35, most of
the error probably being in measurement.  So, flipping it around and making
it a percentage, turning on all of the bits will reduce the brightness by
74% to 75%.
