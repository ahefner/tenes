              Subject: NES Colours and Intensity 


              Hi, folks.  After playing around with Loopy's Palette tester and a video
              digitizer, I've come up with my own palette for the NES that I'm happier with.
               Now before you all groan and say "Another palette?!?", don't delete the
              message.  I also took a look at what effect the various bits in $2001 have on
              the NES' palette on-screen.

              The palettes that I'd used before were good, but I would have to use one
              palette to aid in colour remapping images from RGB down to the NES' palette,
              and a second palette to approximate what you would actually see on the NES'
              screen.  Something like this is essential, because (just as on the
              Commodore-64) if you take something like a digitized image and remap it to an
              exact representation of the target console's palette, the result does not look
              so good.  The NES does not have a "perfect" red, or yellow, for example.  If
              you use a paint program that tries to map a perfect red onto the NES' palette,
              sometimes it won't hit the colour that you wanted.  (Some of you might not
              have a clue as to what I mean by all this, but bear with me...)

              Anyways, the ideal palette used for remapping colours came from an emulator,
              but the palette that I used which would "represent" the NES' palette exactly
              was not very helpful.  The hues seemed to be off; that was my biggest concern.
               So, I digitized the colours from Loopy's palette tester on my NES, and paid
              special attention to the hues of all the colours, and not really to the RGB
              values.

              From what I can tell, the NES does not have each of its colours from x1 to xC
              perfectly spaced out in 30-degree increments of hue (going from 0 to 360
              degrees).  Nor are the hues perfectly constant at varying levels of
              brightness.  The palettes that do try to space out the colours evenly do not
              look much like a real NES' output.

              The hues do, however, vary in an orderly fashion from one another, but it is
              not anything that I can predict or analyze.  Anybody who has an oscilloscope,
              please let's solve this whole palette thing once and for all!   Anyway, I'll
              just attach the palette I made at the bottom and leave it at that.  Anybody
              who wants to try it out can.  (Format is R,G,B and in HEX.)


              *$2001 Issues*

               %fffxxxxt

               fff = Full Background Colour

                 000 = No Effect
                 001 = Emphasize Red (or De-Emphasize Cyan)
                 010 = Emphasize Green (or De-Emphasize Magenta)
                 011 = Emphasize Yellow (or De-Emphasize Blue)
                 100 = Emphasize Blue (or De-Emphasize Yellow)
                 101 = Emphasize Magenta (or De-Emphasize Green)
                 110 = Emphasize Cyan (or De-Emphasize Red)
                 111 = Emphasize Black (or De-Emphasize Red, Green, and Blue)

               t = Monochrome bit

              Bit 0 of $2001 (the Monochrome bit) simply copies the first four greys
              ($00,$10,$20,$30) across the board.  So, any colour in the $2x range will
              appear exactly as $20.  Black, which is arguably $0D or $0E, will look the
              same as $00, which is a middle grey.  This will appear more relevant to what I
              have to say next.

              Bits 7, 6, and 5 of $2001, called the "Full Background Colour" or "Colour
              Intensity" bits could also be described as "colour de-emphasis" bits.  Let me
              explain why.  I compared the colours displayed when using all possible
              combinations of these three bits, and each bit has sort of a predictable
              effect on the display.  When using just one bit of the three, the palette will
              appear to be influenced more in R, G, or B value.  This is achieved by an
              increase in the intensity of the component being emphasized, and also a
              decrease in the brightness of the components not being emphasized.  That is to
              say, if I were emphasizing the green component of the palette (by setting bit
              6 of $2001), the magenta component (green's negative) of each colour is
              functionally reduced.  This would, of course, have the greatest effect on what
              appears as magenta in the NES' palette, which then gets darkened quite a bit
              (since there is no green component in the colour magenta).  This also has a
              large effect on the neighbouring colours to green, as they are the ones in the
              NES' palette that have the most in common to green; they are essentially
              brought even closer in the hue circle to green.  But this change is not
              uniform to all colours in the NES' palette.  It instead seems to be relative
              to the colour being "emphasized" (or de-emphasized, depending on how you look
              at it.)

              Now, if I set two bits of the top three of $2001, a combination of R, G, or B
              is emphasized.  But this does not make the Cyan, Yellow, or Magenta components
              of the NES' palette become brighter.  Instead, the palette darkens even more
              than if only one bit in $2001 were set.  So, more aptly, when two bits of the
              top three of $2001 are set, either Red, Green, or Blue is effectively taken
              out (to a degree) of the palette.

              Finally, when all three of the top bits of $2001 are set, the entire palette
              becomes uniformly darker.  This would suggest that setting bits does more to
              take away certain chromatic components of the NES' palette than to add to
              those components.  (By the way, my NES hasn't croaked yet from setting more
              than one of the Colour Intensity bits.)

              As for the difference between the "Full Background Colour" mode when bit 0 of
              $2001 is clear and the "Colour Intensity" mode when bit 0 of $2001 is set:
              there is no difference.  The "Full Background Colour" effect is applied to the
              entire palette in a normal way.  If the Monochrome bit is set, then all
              palette entries from $01 to $0F are mirrored to $00; all from $11 to $1F, to
              $10; etc...  The appearance of the NES' palette when in Monochrome mode, then,
              depends entirely on the appearance of colours $00, $10, $20, and $30 in the
              palette.


              Okay, enough of the boring words; here are some boring numbers.

              Here are some *average* amounts showing the change in the RGB components of a
              neutral colour (ie: grey or white) when a certain colour is being emphasized
              through $2001.

              Red being emphasized:  R: 123.9%   G:  91.5%   B:  74.3%
              Green "      "      :  R:  79.4%   G: 108.6%   B:  88.2%
              Blue  "      "      :  R:  90.5%   G: 102.6%   B: 127.7%
              Cyan  "      "      :  R:  74.1%   G:  98.7%   B: 100.1% 
              Magenta      "      :  R: 102.3%   G:  90.8%   B:  97.9%
              Yellow       "      :  R: 101.9%   G:  98.0%   B:  65.3%
              Black "      "      :  R:  75.0%   G:  75.0%   B:  75.0%

              (any number less than 100% means a decrease in value for that colour component
              (after the corresponding bit in $2001 is set).  Any number greater than 100%
              means an increase in value.  A value of 100% means that the colour component
              does not change at all after a certain bit in $2001 is set.  For example, if
              all three of the top bits of $2001 are set, the brightness of the screen drops
              to 75% of its original brightness.)

              I hope this helps somebody in some way.  It's pretty useless to me, but maybe
              this effect will be implemented in more emulators someday.  Now for my
              palette...
