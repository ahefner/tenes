  The file 'NESAUDIO.TXT' has been included into the archive. This goes
  over how the NES's analogue circuitry works, and explains analogue
  audio (specific to the NES) in detail. Feel free to read it and learn
  something :-)

  Due to new information, 'NESAUDIO.TXT' may be considered, literally,
  100% inaccurate. :-( Please read it to learn more about analogue cir-
  cuitry, but not the NES's possible IC-based APU.
