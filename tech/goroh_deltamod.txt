              Japanese NES(Famicom) has Delta Modulation Channel($4010-$4013)
              I don't know what DAC means.
              Does American NES have a special device to play Delta Modulation?
              CPU of Famicom performs Delta Modulation with own special module.

              $4010 AB--ffff
              A: if B=0, interrupt occers when finished playing.
              B: Play-Mode  0:no-Loop 1:Loop
              ffff : frequency
              Famicom performs Delta Modulation by reading ROM($c000-$ffff).
              ,This access occers every some clocks.

              ffff clocks 428*8 mean CPU perform 1bit every 428clock,so DMA
              occers every 428*8 clock.

              0 428*8
              1 380*8
              2 340*8
              3 320*8
              4 286*8
              5 254*8
              6 226*8
              7 214*8
              8 190*8
              9 160*8
              10 142*8
              11 128*8
              12 106*8
              13 85*8
              14 72*8
              15 54*8

              $4011 Immediate volume

              $4012 Delta Channel DMA Address Register
              This register means where CPU starts reading ROM.
              Address = $c000+(data<<6) 

              $4013 Delta Channel Data count Register
              This register means how meny data access occer.
              AmountofData = data<<4+1

              $4015 bit ...Edcba
              E: E=1 play sound.   E=0 stop sound
